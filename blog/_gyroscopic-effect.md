## Objective

I think, [**Gyroscopes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope) are cool,
They stand and balance themselves when provided with angular momentum but fall
over when standing still, just like cycle. For long time, I didnt understand how
it worked, Why do rotating things seem to balance themselves?

## Why do Objects Roll Over and Fall?

On a normal object, [Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity) applies a
force downwards at every point on the body and surface at the point of contact
applies a force equal to gravity but opposite in direction (upwards).

for mathematical simplicity, lets assume that the gravitational force acts at
**Center of Gravity** which for small objects, under uniform gravity (like on
surface of earth) in the absense of
[Angular Acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration) can
be assumed to be at
[Center of Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass)

Now, Ignoring friction, Gravitational Force and Normal reaction force from the
surface acts like a
[Couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couple_(mechanics)) and applies torque on the
object. 

Now the above diagram is exagrated, the couple doesn't need to be that large. 
Even a tiniest of microscopic couple can tilt the object slightly. And this tilt will 
increase the distance between CoM and PoC. Which causes more couple and then more tilt
and so on...

## How do you prevent fall?

To prevent the fall, Imagine if the couple didnt have enough time to tilt the object.
