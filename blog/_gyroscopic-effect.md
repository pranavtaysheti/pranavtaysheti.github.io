## Objective

I think, [**Gyroscopes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope) are cool,
They stand and balance themselves when provided with angular momentum but fall
over when standing still, just like cycle. For long time, I didnt understand how
it worked, Why do rotating things seem to balance themselves?

## Why do Objects Roll Over and Fall?

On a normal object, [Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity) applies a
force downwards at every point on the body and surface at the point of contact
applies a force equal to gravity but opposite in direction (upwards).

for mathematical simplicity, lets assume that the gravitational force acts at
**Center of Gravity** which for small objects, under uniform gravity (like on
surface of earth) in the absense of
[Angular Acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration) can
be assumed to be at
[Center of Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass)

Now, Ignoring friction, Gravitational Force and Normal reaction force from the
surface acts like a
[Couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couple_(mechanics)) and applies
Torque on the object, causing it to turn and fall.

## Opposing Torque

Now, in order for Gyroscope to not be toppled, some torque should act in
direction opposite to the torque due to couple of Gravity and Normal Force.
