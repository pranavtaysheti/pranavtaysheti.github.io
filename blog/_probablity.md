## Understanding Probablity

skip over this if you already know basics of probablity and what it means to say that "probablity of coin turning heads is 50%".

Otherwise, I'll try by best.

Lets say you want to find the probablity of occurance of an odd number on the roll of dice. Now we intuitiuvly know that answer is 50%. But how do describe this thing mathematically?

Here, We perform the **Experiment** of **rolling the dice**.

Now, there are few assumptions we can comfortably about this experiment:

1. All the outcomes of this experiment are \[1,2,3,4,5,6\] and all of them are **equally probable**.

2. The dice roll **must** return us a number.
   (Here, We dont consider the cases that dice rolls under the sofa/ stolen by cat/ eaten by your brother.)

Now, in simple terms, we can define the probablity for now as:

$$
\frac
{\text{number of times a favourable event occurs}}
{\text{the number of times experiment conducted}}
$$

Here, the **Favourable Events** are that the dice rolls in \[1,3,5\].

## Now what if we roll **many** dices
